# Malvin-Telecom-SQL-analysis
This project analyzes customer churn at Maven Telecom to understand why customers are leaving, who is most at risk, and the resulting revenue impact. The goal was not just to calculate churn metrics, but to build a reusable, production-style analytics pipeline using SQL Server and Power BI.
