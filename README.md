# Malvin-Telecom-SQL-analysis
This project analyzes customer churn at Maven Telecom to understand why customers are leaving, who is most at risk, and the resulting revenue impact. The goal was not just to calculate churn metrics, but to build a reusable, production style analytics pipeline using SQL Server and Power BI.

### Introduction
Customer retention is critical for sustained growth in the telecom industry. Despite this, customer churn is inevitable and can significantly impact revenue and long term profitability.  

In this project, I analyzed **Maven Telecom’s customer churn dataset** to identify the **key drivers of churn**, understand **which customers are most at risk**, and propose **data driven retention strategies**. The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

- What are the key drivers of customer churn?
- Is the company losing high value customers?
- What is the ideal profile of a churned customer?
- What actions can Maven Telecom take to reduce churn?

### 🛠 Customer Retention Strategies

**1. Loyalty Programs**  
Since competitors offering better deals is the top churn driver and many churned customers had no promotions, Maven should introduce loyalty programs. These may include discounts, free upgrades, or additional features for long term customers.

**2. Improve Customer Support**  
Invest in training and performance incentives for support staff to improve service quality and customer satisfaction.

**3. Better Devices**  
Evaluate and upgrade device offerings to remain competitive in terms of performance, features, and pricing.

**4. Expand Premium Tech Support**  
Customers without premium tech support churn more frequently. Offering this service more broadly could significantly reduce churn.

**5. Improve Fiber Optic Services**  
Enhance fiber optic reliability, speed, and customer support to reduce churn in this high risk segment.

**6. Engage High Value Customers**  
Provide personalized offers, proactive communication, and premium support to retain high value customers.

**7. Strengthen After sales Engagement**  
Implement regular customer check-ins via surveys, calls, or emails to monitor satisfaction and resolve issues early.
